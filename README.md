# R for Data Science
My code (which varies from the examples) from reviewing [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), a book I read some time back. Authors source for the book is [on github](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds).

## Setup
```{R}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman")
```
